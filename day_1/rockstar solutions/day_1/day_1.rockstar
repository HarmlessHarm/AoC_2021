The music is mysterious
My world is nothing

Listen to the metal
If the metal is not mysterious
Burn the metal
Until the metal is nothing
If the metal is stronger than The music
Build my world up

Put the metal in the music
Listen to the metal
If the metal is not mysterious
Burn the metal


Shout my world
